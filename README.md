Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering differs from traditional programming in that:
a)	It encompasses a broader scope, including requirements analysis, design, development, testing, and maintenance, whereas traditional programming focuses mainly on coding.
b)	It follows a structured process (like SDLC), ensuring systematic development, while traditional programming may lack such formal methodologies.
c)	Oftenly involves larger teams and interdisciplinary collaboration, unlike traditional programming, which might be done individually or in smaller teams.			
d)	It places a strong emphasis on testing, validation, and verification to ensure software quality, reliability, and performance.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
it is a structured process used by software developers and project managers to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software applications.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
It has several phases 
a)	Requirements – gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
b)	Design – creating high level detailed design software 
c)	Implementation – writing code and building the software according to the design specification
d)	Deployment- releasing the software to users 
e)	Maintenance – providing ongoing support and enhancement to the software after deployment
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before the next one begins

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile Model
Iterative and Incremental: Development occurs in small, manageable units called iterations, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
•	Flexibility: Welcomes changing requirements even late in the development process.
•	Collaboration: Emphasizes close collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
•	Customer Feedback: Regular feedback from customers and stakeholders is integrated throughout the process.
Preferred Scenarios
Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve or are not well-defined initially, such as innovative or user-centric applications.
Waterfall Model:
	Sequential Phases: Development follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
•	Rigid Structure: Changes to requirements are difficult and costly to implement once the project is underway.
•	Documentation: Emphasizes comprehensive documentation at each stage of development.
Preferred Scenarios
Suitable for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as regulatory compliance software or systems with predictable environments.
The Key Differences between Agile and Waterfall is:
a)	Agile is flexible and adaptive, while Waterfall is rigid and linear.
b)	Agile uses iterative cycles, whereas Waterfall follows a single pass through defined phases.
c)	Agile involves continuous customer collaboration, while Waterfall involves customer input mainly at the beginning and end of the project


Requirements Engineering:it is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Process:
a)	Elicitation: Gather requirements through interviews, surveys, observation, and workshops.
b)	Analysis: Analyse and refine requirements to ensure clarity, completeness, and feasibility.
c)	Specification: Document the requirements in a clear, concise, and organized manner, often in a requirements specification document.
d)	Validation: Verify that the requirements accurately reflect the needs of stakeholders and are feasible for implementation
e)	Management: Monitor and manage requirements throughout the project to accommodate changes and ensure traceability.

Software Design Principles:are fundamental guidelines and best practices that help software developers create software that is reliable, maintainable, scalable, and efficient
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?Modularity from my understanding is the process that involves dividing a software system into distinct, independent components or modules, each responsible for a specific functionality.
It improves maintainability and scalability of software systems in the following ways 
a)	Easier to understand, debug, and update individual modules without affecting the entire system
b)	Modules can be developed and deployed independently, allowing the system to scale more efficiently
c)	Modules can be reused across different projects, saving development time and resources.
d)	Multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously, accelerating development.

Testing in Software Engineering:is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system performs as intended
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?levels of Software Testing:
a)	Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly.
b)	Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between integrated units or components to detect interface defects.
c)	System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
d)	Acceptance Testing: Tests the system from the user's perspective to ensure it meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Why is testing crucial in software development?
a)	It ensures the software is reliable, performs well, and meets user expectations.
b)	Identifies and fixes defects early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort of fixing issues later.
c)	Validates that the software meets requirements and specifications

Version Control Systems: are tools that manage changes to source code and track the history of modifications over time. They facilitate collaboration and ensure code integrity.
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
why are they important in software development?
a)	Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts.
b)	Records changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
c)	Supports parallel development through branches and integrates changes seamlessly.
Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Software Project Management: 
a)	Git: Distributed VCS with features like branching, merging, and collaboration through platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
b)	Subversion (SVN): Centralized VCS with a focus on versioning and directory management.
c)	Mercurial: Distributed VCS similar to Git, known for its simplicity and ease of use.

Software Project Management:
is the discipline of planning, organizing, and managing resources to bring about the successful completion of specific software project goals and objectives

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Role of a Software Project Manager:
a)	Planning: Define project scope, objectives, and deliverables. Develop a detailed project plan and schedule.
b)	Resource Allocation: Allocate resources effectively to ensure the project progresses smoothly.
c)	Risk Management: Identify, assess, and mitigate project risks.

Challenges faced include:
a)	Balancing scope, time, and budget constraints.
b)	Managing changing requirements and stakeholder expectations.
c)	Ensuring effective communication and collaboration within the team.

Software Maintenance:
It is the process that involves modifying and updating software after its initial deployment to correct issues, improve performance, or adapt to new requirements
